# I AM (Apply Math) in My World

I AM (Apply Math) in my world is a game aimed to reduce math anxiety and increase math fluency in 4th and 5th grade hispanic students.

The game plays through a set of scenarios (such as shopping at a grocery store, ordering food at a resteraunt, or modifying a recipe) that applies math to the real world. The goal is help show students that math is everywhere but is nothing to be afraid of. The game is intended to be played at home, to help reinforce the lessons taught at school.

It is a web-based game that is currently being developed for the computer but eventually would also function on phones.
